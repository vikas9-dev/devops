# EBS (Elastic Block Storage)

## 1. Understanding and Using Amazon EBS with EC2

In this section, we’ll explore Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS), a key storage service used with EC2 instances in AWS. Think of EBS as the virtual hard drive attached to your EC2 instance—it stores your operating system, applications, and any additional data like website files or databases.

### What is EBS?

Amazon EBS provides two main features:

1. **EBS Volumes** – These are block-level storage devices that function like traditional hard drives.
2. **Snapshots** – These are point-in-time backups of your EBS volumes.

EBS volumes are essential for running your EC2 instance's operating system (OS). For example, when you launch an EC2 instance and see an 8GB root volume, that’s an EBS volume storing your OS. You can also attach additional volumes for storing application-specific data like web files or databases.

### Key Characteristics of EBS

- **Block Storage**: Similar to physical disks, EBS uses block-level storage, allowing fine-grained control and consistent performance.
- **Availability Zone Specific**: When creating an EBS volume, you must select the same Availability Zone (AZ) as your EC2 instance for it to be attachable.
- **Replication**: EBS volumes are automatically replicated within the same AZ to protect against hardware failure, but not across multiple AZs.

### EBS Volume Types

AWS offers several types of EBS volumes, each designed for specific use cases:

- **General Purpose SSD (gp2/gp3)**: Ideal for most workloads, offering a balance between cost and performance.
- **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/io2)**: Designed for high-performance databases where speed and consistency are crucial.
- **Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)**: Best for big data, log processing, and data warehousing.
- **Cold HDD (sc1)**: Low-cost storage for infrequently accessed data such as backups.
- **Magnetic (standard)**: Previous-generation, lowest cost option, suitable for archival.

For most general workloads, **General Purpose SSD (gp3)** is recommended due to its good balance of price and performance. See more about EBS volume types [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-volume-types.html).

### Creating and Attaching a New EBS Volume

In the session, we walked through creating a CentOS EC2 instance with a root EBS volume and then adding an additional 5GB EBS volume to store web server images. The key steps included:

1. **Launch an EC2 instance** with CentOS Stream 9 using the AWS Marketplace.
2. **Create a new EBS volume** (5GB, gp2) in the same Availability Zone as the instance.
3. **Attach the new volume** to the EC2 instance.

Let us Launch an EC2 instance with `CentOS Stream 9 | Support by SupportedImages` using the AWS Marketplace :

- Name: `web01`
- Image: `CentOS Stream 9` (`ami-0b74b23e2438b6f44`). It gives default user name: `ec2-user`
- Instance Type: `t2.micro` (free tier)
- Root Volume: `8 GB` of `gp2`
- Availability Zone: `us-east-1d`
- Assign existing key pair: `web-dev-key`
- Assign existing security group: `web-sg` (Make Sure the inbound rule allows SSH (port 22) from _My IP_ and HTTP (port 80) from _My IP_)
- Launch the instance.

After the instance is launched, login to it using the SSH command:

```bash
cd c/install/aws-keys/
chmod 400 web-dev-key.pem # Important: Change the file permission
ssh -i web-dev-key.pem ec2-user@13.218.121.43
```

Run the below commands:-

```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum install httpd wget unzip -y
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
cd /tmp
wget https://www.tooplate.com/zip-templates/2119_gymso_fitness.zip
unzip -o 2119_gymso_fitness.zip
cp -r 2119_gymso_fitness/* /var/www/html/
systemctl restart httpd
```

Open the browser and visit: `http://<Public_IP>`

In the storage section, you can see the root volume. After clicking on the Volume ID, it will take you to the EBS console. Rename the Volume to `web01-ROOT-Volume` for better readability. The `web01-ROOT-Volume` will be in the same Availability Zone as the instance.

## Creating and Attaching a New EBS Volume in AWS

When working with Amazon EC2 instances, there may be a need to expand your storage by attaching additional volumes. Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides block-level storage that can be attached to EC2 instances. In this section, we’ll walk through the step-by-step process of creating a new EBS volume, attaching it to an instance, and preparing it for use — including partitioning, formatting, and mounting it.

### 1. **Understanding the Requirement**

Suppose we have a web server running on an EC2 instance, and we want to store image files in a dedicated volume separate from the root volume. The requirement is to add a 5 GB EBS volume for these images, ensuring we stay within AWS's 30 GB free tier limit.

### 2. **Creating an EBS Volume**

1. **Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard:**

   - Go to the **Volumes** section under **Elastic Block Store** in the EC2 console.

2. **Click on “Create Volume”:**

   - **Volume type**: Select **General Purpose SSD (gp2)** — ideal for most workloads and covered under the free tier.
   - **Size**: Enter `5 GiB`.
   - **Availability Zone**: Make sure this matches the zone of your EC2 instance (e.g., `us-east-1d`). Volumes can only be attached to instances in the same zone.
   - (Optional) **Tag the volume** for easy identification, e.g., `Name: web01-images`.

3. **Click “Create Volume”**.

### 3. **Attaching the Volume to the EC2 Instance**

1. **After the volume is created**, select it from the Volumes list.
2. Click on **Actions > Attach Volume**.
3. **Select the instance** (e.g., `web01`) from the dropdown that appears.
4. Click **Attach**.

### 4. **Preparing the Volume in the EC2 Instance**

After the volume is attached, log in to your EC2 instance via SSH.

```bash
ssh -i path/to/key.pem ec2-user@<INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP>
```

Switch to the root user:

```bash
sudo -i
```

### 5. **Identify the New Volume**

Use the `lsblk` or `fdisk` command to list block devices:

```bash
lsblk
```

You should see a new device (e.g., `/dev/xvdf`) with no partitions.

### 6. **Partition the Volume**

Use `fdisk` to create a new partition on the volume:

```bash
fdisk /dev/xvdf
```

Then follow these steps inside `fdisk`:

- Press `n` to create a new partition.
- Press `p` to choose a primary partition.
- Accept default partition number and sectors by pressing Enter.
- Press `w` to write the partition and exit.

### 7. **Format the Partition**

Format the new partition (`/dev/xvdf1`) with the ext4 filesystem:

```bash
mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf1
```

### 8. **Create a Mount Point and Mount the Volume**

1. Create the directory where you want to mount the volume:

```bash
mkdir -p /var/www/html/images
```

2. Temporarily mount the volume:

```bash
mount /dev/xvdf1 /var/www/html/images
```

3. Verify the mount:

```bash
df -h
```

### 9. **Make the Mount Persistent**

To ensure the volume mounts automatically on reboot:

1. Edit the fstab file:

```bash
nano /etc/fstab
```

2. Add the following line at the end:

```
/dev/xvdf1  /var/www/html/images  ext4  defaults  0  0
```

3. Save and exit, then test the configuration:

```bash
mount -a
```

If no errors appear, the mount configuration is correct.

### 10. **Moving Existing Data (Optional)**

If the `/images` folder previously had content on the root volume, move it to a backup before mounting:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/img-backup
mv /var/www/html/images/* /tmp/img-backup/
```

Then, after mounting the new volume, move the files back:

```bash
mv /tmp/img-backup/* /var/www/html/images/
```

### 11. **Verify Web Server Access**

Restart your web server (e.g., Apache):

```bash
systemctl restart httpd
```

Check that your images are served correctly from the browser. If they do not appear, it may be due to **SELinux** policies.

### 12. **Optional: Disable SELinux (for troubleshooting)**

If SELinux is blocking access and you’re in a testing environment:

1. Edit the config:

```bash
nano /etc/selinux/config
```

2. Change `SELINUX=enforcing` to `SELINUX=disabled` and reboot:

```bash
reboot
```

By following this process, you've successfully created, attached, and mounted a new EBS volume to your EC2 instance. This setup not only helps with better data organization but also allows for scalable storage expansion in the future.
